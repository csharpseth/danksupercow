I am a 20 year old full stack web and game developer. Most of my projects are open source, 
but I am pursuing some more professional avenues at the moment.

## Light Controller Setup
 - First Upload the supplied 'd150_lightcontroller' code to your Arduino Nano

 - Then wire the Arduino Inputs as follows:
  - D2 = Left Signal Switch
  - D3 = Right Signal Switch
  - D4 = Brake Switch
  - D5 = Headlight Switch
  - D6 = Kill Lights Switch

 - Now wire the Arduino Outputs as follows:
  - D7 = Left Front Signal Lights Relay
  - D8 = Right Front Signal Lights Relay
  - D9 = Left Rear Signal Lights Relay
  - D10 = Right Rear Signal Lights Relay
  - D11 = Low Beam Lights Relay
  - D12 = High Beam Lights Relay
